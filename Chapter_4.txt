What is Data Analysis?
-------------------------
Jobs--
    -- Business Analyst
    --- Data Analyst
    ----Lot of others
Process
----------
{(a) Inspection (Raw Data) --> (b) Transformation (Transform data into desired shape) -->(c) Cleaning () --> (d) Modeling (Simply taking an averag,mean,median,variance,stddiv etc) } Data --> (e) Analyze trends and Make Decisions

Part-A: Introduction to Numpy
Step-1: Multidimentional Array
[
    [1,2,3],
    [4,5,6],
    [7,8,9]
]

Step-2: Methods of processing Arrays
- read from it
- write to it
- delete it
- update it
- calculate the typical CRUD operation

Step-3: Perform the element by element operations

T: [10,7,9]
T[0]- 10
T[1]- 7 XXXXX
T[2]- 9+2=11
T: [10,11]

Step-4: Advanced Mathematical Operations
Linear Algebra
--------------
1ac+1washroom+2bed+1balcony = 2000
2x+y-z= 8 Room101SeaFind
-3x-y+2z= -11
-2x+y+2z= -3
To such a system, one may associate its matrix
M (3X3)=  [
         2  1 -1
        -3 -1 2
        -2  1 2
    ]

Output, V (3X1)=[
     8
    -11
    -3
  ]
X (3X1)=[x
   y
   z]

MX=V
(3X3) (3X1)= (3X1)

Operations in Nympy?
- 3 types
(i) Linear Algenba and random generation
(ii) Mathematical and Logical (Sum, Variant, stddiv etc)
(iii) Fourier transform and shape manupulation (Signal Analysis)


Numpy Array
Multidimentional Object ---- (a) actual data
                             (b) meta data





Linearly Spaced Vector 



Q1. Solving the dataformation problem
Q2. 
(i)Create a 2D array
(ii) Save this array into newFile.csv using delimiter=','
(iii) load the file into an array B using the np.genfromtxt(filename,delimiter) function


Pandas
